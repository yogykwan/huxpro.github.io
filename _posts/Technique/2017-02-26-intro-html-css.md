# Basic HTML and CSS
## HTML, CSS and Boxes

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) - the standard markup language used to create web pages.
- CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language.
- DOM (Document Object Model) - a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML (and other markup languages). The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree.

## CSS Frameworks, Responsive Layouts

- grid based design: every part is box-shaped, use horizontal and vertical lines in turn to cut the page and get layout
- apply te framework - CSS frameworks like Bootstrape have pre-prepared CSS to achieve desirable effects
- semantic structure - use tags understandable to both human and browser(eg. `h1`, `img`, `p`) to create a DOM tree
- tune the page - placekitten.com and placehold.it can get various sizes of images, use Chrome DevTools to modify and test
- code, test, define - circular workflow to tune the page as similar as possible to mockup

## Bootstrap and Other Frameworks

- Bootstrap grid system - `container` -> `row` -> `col-md-6`
- responsive page - `img-responsive`
- Bootstrap typography - `text-right`, `text-uppercase`
- custom CSS - self-built CSS to supplement some effects out of framework
- interactive taste - link Bootstrap and JQuery JavaScript files, use `data-data-toggle="modal"`, `data-target`, `modal-fade`
